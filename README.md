# swift-sense

This package will help you eliminate boilerplate code and would add extension convenience to your project whenever needed.

## Description

After writing the same Network code in every project, I noticed that what if I can just freeze certain part of the code which I always rely on for basic tasks like making a network requests and parsing the data value into a `Result` type.  This gave me the inspiration to create this small package as a way to add dependency to any project which makes everyday task a little bit easier.
